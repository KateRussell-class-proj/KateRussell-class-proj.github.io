   <h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
   <li> <em>Personal background:</em>  My name is Kate Russell and I was born in Virginia but have lived in North Carolina for almost 20 years. 
      I have been living in Mooresville for 15. I am a huge nerd with some of my favorite media being Lord of the Rings, How to Train Your Dragon, 
      Critical Role, and Star Wars. When I’m not working on endless homework and personal art projects you can find me bird watching or playing 
      Dungeons and Dragons. I have three siblings, one of which is a UNCC alumni and works for the dining services here on campus!
      If you follow Niner Diners on Instagram, you’ve probably seen a lot of his content. 
      I absolutely love animals and I have four dogs named Reecie, Peanut, Buttercup, and Boots. 
      Boots and Buttercup are specially abled and require wheelchairs for getting around. </li>
