   <h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul class="list">
   <li> <strong>Personal background:</strong>  My name is Kate Russell and I was born in Virginia but have lived in North Carolina for almost 20 years. <br> 
      I have been living in Mooresville for 15. I am a huge nerd with some of my favorite media being Lord of the Rings, How to Train Your Dragon, <br>
      Critical Role, and Star Wars. When I’m not working on endless homework and personal art projects you can find me bird watching or playing <br>
      Dungeons and Dragons. I have three siblings, one of which is a UNCC alumni and works for the dining services here on campus!<br>
      If you follow Niner Diners on Instagram, you’ve probably seen a lot of his content. 
      I absolutely love animals and I have four dogs named Reecie, Peanut, Buttercup, and Boots. <br> 
      Boots and Buttercup are specially abled and require wheelchairs for getting around. </li>
   <li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I am an illustration major and I am set to graduate Fall 2025. I hope to work either in <br>
      publishing, board games, or animation. When I graduate I’ll probably just freelance until I can actually score a job <br>
      as the creative world is super competitive. I have a few children’s books in the works right now. Stay tuned!<br>
      <li><strong>Background in this subject:</strong> Absolutely none. I can barely even open a Google Doc but somehow I did it. Winning. </li>
   <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  Macbook Pro</li>
   <li><strong>Classes I'm taking and why:</strong></li>
<ol>
   <li><strong>ARTL 3185 Digital Drawing and Painting</strong> - I have never had a formal class on digital painting <br>
      but working digitally is the industry standard right now and I’d like to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. 
      Plus it will help me learn how to combine traditional and digital skills which is super awesome! 
      <li><strong>ARTR 3263 Book and Paper Making</strong> - I like to have a space to play in the midst of all my illustrative pursuits.
         Illustration is a very precise and taxing field. While I enjoy it, it’s nice to do something that is tactile with less pressure. 
         I have taken up bookbinding as a hobby and I’m taking this class to learn more about it so that I can continue to have a place to 
         let loose and get creative after I graduate. </li>
   <li><strong>ARTM 3103 Animation Production</strong> - I absolutely LOVE animation and making things move. I have some experience in animation but I am excited
      to take a formal class on it in order to sharpen my skills. My favorite animation to do is 2D animation because it’s just drawing a ton, but
      I also enjoy claymation and puppet animation. I have only done a little bit of 3D animation but it seems cool too! I’d like to learn more someday. </li> 
   <li><strong>MUPF 1123 Women’s Choir </strong> - Music comes from the soul and speaks what words cannot. I love singing, it is very therapeutic for me. I grew up singing in 
      church and I am excited to take a class and grow my skills. </li> 
   <li><strong>ITSC 1110 Introduction to Computer Science Principles</strong> - I despise math with all of my being but I needed one last math credit so I decided to take this. Let’s hope 
      computer science is better than math!
</li>
</ol>
   <li><strong>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: </strong> When I was in Yellowstone in 2022 I saw 9 bears, 8 of them were American 
      Black Bears, and one was a Grizzly! I enjoy wildlife photography and I managed to photograph four of them. 
      <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I self-published a children’s book on Amazon! It’s called “C is for Corgi” and I published it last November.
         Go check it out!  (I’m basically just advertising at this point)</li>
