   <h1>Introduction</h1>
<ul>
   <li> <strong>Personal background:</strong>  My name is Kate Russell and I was born in Virginia but have lived in North Carolina for almost 20 years. 
      I have been living in Mooresville for 15. I am a huge nerd with some of my favorite media being Lord of the Rings, How to Train Your Dragon, 
      Critical Role, and Star Wars. When I’m not working on endless homework and personal art projects you can find me bird watching or playing 
      Dungeons and Dragons. I have three siblings, one of which is a UNCC alumni and works for the dining services here on campus!
      If you follow Niner Diners on Instagram, you’ve probably seen a lot of his content. 
      I absolutely love animals and I have four dogs named Reecie, Peanut, Buttercup, and Boots. 
      Boots and Buttercup are specially abled and require wheelchairs for getting around. </li>
   <li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I am an illustration major and I am set to graduate Fall 2025. I hope to work either in 
      publishing, board games, or animation. When I graduate I’ll probably just freelance until I can actually score a job 
      as the creative world is super competitive. I have a few children’s books in the works right now. Stay tuned!
      <li><strong>Background in this subject:</strong> Absolutely none. I can barely even open a Google Doc but somehow I did it. Winning. </li>
   <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  Macbook Pro</li>
   <li><strong>Classes I'm taking and why:</strong></li>
<ol>
   <li><strong>ARTL 3185 Digital Drawing and Painting</strong> - I have never had a formal class on digital painting 
      but working digitally is the industry standard right now and I’d like to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. 
      Plus it will help me learn how to combine traditional and digital skills which is super awesome!
