    <h1>AI Introduction</h1>
    Hi! I’m Kate Russell.
I was born in Virginia but have called North Carolina home for nearly 20 years—15 of those right here in Mooresville. 
    I’m a self-proclaimed nerd with a deep love for The Lord of the Rings, How to Train Your Dragon, Critical Role, and Star Wars. 
    When I’m not buried under homework or working on personal art projects, you’ll probably find me birdwatching or playing Dungeons & Dragons.

I come from a big family with three siblings—one of whom is a proud UNCC alum and currently works with dining services on campus. If you follow Niner 
    Diners on Instagram, chances are you’ve seen his work!

I’m a huge animal lover with four wonderful dogs: Reecie, Peanut, Buttercup, and Boots. Buttercup and Boots are specially abled and use wheelchairs to get around—and yes,
    they’re adorable. 

Academic Journey
I’m currently majoring in Illustration and set to graduate in Fall 2025. My dream is to work in publishing, board games, or animation. Until then, 
    I’ll probably be freelancing my way through the creative world—because let’s be honest, it’s competitive out there! I’m also working on a few children’s books, so stay 
    tuned for those.

Tech Skills (or Lack Thereof)
My background in computer science is, well…nonexistent. I barely managed to open a Google Doc, so the fact you’re reading this means I’m already winning.

Primary Computer: MacBook Pro

Courses I'm Taking & Why:

ARTL 3185: Digital Drawing and Painting
Digital art is the industry standard, but I’ve never taken a formal class on it. I’m excited to fill in the gaps and learn how to merge my traditional skills with 
    digital techniques.

ARTR 3263: Book and Paper Making
Bookbinding has become a personal hobby, and I’m taking this class to dig deeper into the craft. It’s a welcome creative outlet that gives me space to play without 
    the pressure of precision.

ARTM 3103: Animation Production
Animation is one of my favorite art forms—especially 2D, because I love to draw! I’ve dabbled in claymation and puppet animation too. I’m hoping this course
    sharpens my skills and opens up new possibilities.

MUPF 1123: Women’s Choir
Singing has always been therapeutic for me. I grew up singing in church, and I’m excited to grow musically in a more formal setting.

ITSC 1110: Intro to Computer Science Principles
Full honesty—I loathe math, but I needed one more credit. Fingers crossed computer science turns out to be the cooler cousin.

Fun Fact:
When I visited Yellowstone in 2022, I saw nine bears—eight black bears and one grizzly! I’m into wildlife photography and managed to capture photos of four of them.

Something I’m Proud Of:
I self-published a children’s book on Amazon last November! It’s called C is for Corgi, and yes—this is me shamelessly plugging it. Go check it out!
