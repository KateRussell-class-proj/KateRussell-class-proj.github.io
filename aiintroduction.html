    <h1>AI Introduction</h1>
   <h2></h2> <strong>Hi! I’m Kate Russell.</strong></h2>
<p>I was born in Virginia but have called North Carolina home for nearly 20 years—15 of those right here in Mooresville. <br>
    I’m a self-proclaimed nerd with a deep love for The Lord of the Rings, How to Train Your Dragon, Critical Role, and Star Wars. <br>
    When I’m not buried under homework or working on personal art projects, you’ll probably find me birdwatching or playing Dungeons & Dragons. <br>

I come from a big family with three siblings—one of whom is a proud UNCC alum and currently works with dining services on campus. If you follow Niner <br>
    Diners on Instagram, chances are you’ve seen his work!<br>

I’m a huge animal lover with four wonderful dogs: Reecie, Peanut, Buttercup, and Boots. Buttercup and Boots are specially abled and use wheelchairs to get around—and yes, <br>
    they’re adorable. <br>

<strong>Academic Journey</strong><br>
I’m currently majoring in Illustration and set to graduate in Fall 2025. My dream is to work in publishing, board games, or animation. <br> 
    Until then, I’ll probably be freelancing my way through the creative world—because let’s be honest, it’s competitive out there! <br>
    I’m also working on a few children’s books, so stay tuned for those. <br>

<strong>Tech Skills (or Lack Thereof) </strong><br>
My background in computer science is, well…nonexistent. I barely managed to open a Google Doc, so the fact you’re reading this means I’m already winning. <br>

<strong>Primary Computer: MacBook Pro <br>

Courses I'm Taking & Why: </strong><br>

<strong>ARTL 3185: Digital Drawing and Painting</strong><br>
Digital art is the industry standard, but I’ve never taken a formal class on it. I’m excited to fill in the gaps and learn how to merge my traditional skills with <br>
    digital techniques.

<strong>ARTR 3263: Book and Paper Making</strong><br>
Bookbinding has become a personal hobby, and I’m taking this class to dig deeper into the craft. It’s a welcome creative outlet that gives me space to play without 
    the pressure of precision.

<strong>ARTM 3103: Animation Production</strong><br>
Animation is one of my favorite art forms—especially 2D, because I love to draw! I’ve dabbled in claymation and puppet animation too. I’m hoping this course<br>
    sharpens my skills and opens up new possibilities.<br>

<strong>MUPF 1123: Women’s Choir</strong><br>
Singing has always been therapeutic for me. I grew up singing in church, and I’m excited to grow musically in a more formal setting.<br>

<strong>ITSC 1110: Intro to Computer Science Principles</strong><br>
Full honesty—I loathe math, but I needed one more credit. Fingers crossed computer science turns out to be the cooler cousin.<br>

<strong>Fun Fact:</strong><br>
When I visited Yellowstone in 2022, I saw nine bears—eight black bears and one grizzly! I’m into wildlife photography and managed to capture photos of four of them.<br>

<strong>Something I’m Proud Of:</strong><br>
I self-published a children’s book on Amazon last November! It’s called C is for Corgi, and yes—this is me shamelessly plugging it. Go check it out!
